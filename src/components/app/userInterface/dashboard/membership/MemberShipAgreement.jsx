                  breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity

                  American Arbitration Association ("AAA") before an arbitrator
                  selected pursuant to the AAA rules. The decision of the
                  arbitrator will be final and binding. Any final award or
                  judgment may be filed and enforced in any court of competent
                  jurisdiction. The parties shall share equally in the costs
                  assessed for the arbitration, and each party shall bear its
                  own attorneys' fees and costs. Any arbitration proceeding may

                  Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
                  commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections
