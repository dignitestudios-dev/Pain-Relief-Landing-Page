            (the "Arbitration Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
            event of any actual, alleged or threatened violation of
            confidentiality or violation of the other party’s intellectual
            property or other proprietary rights, the non-breaching party may
            immediately resort to court proceedings in a court of competent
            jurisdiction as set forth below in order to seek immediate
            injunctive relief without posting of a bond, proof of damages or
            other similar requirement. The institution of any action for
            injunctive relief shall not constitute a waiver of the right or
            obligation of any party to submit any claim seeking relief other
            than injunctive relief to arbitration.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Pain Relief USA.
          </li>
          <li>
            The arbitration proceeding will be administered by the American
            Arbitration Association ("AAA") before an arbitrator selected
            pursuant to the AAA rules. The decision of the arbitrator will be
            final and binding. Any final award or judgment may be filed and
            enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties shall
            share equally in the costs assessed for the arbitration, and each
            party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs. Any arbitration
            proceeding may not be consolidated or joined with any other
            proceeding and will not proceed as a class action. THE PARTIES
            UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO
            LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE
            THEIR CASE, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
            INVOLVING MULTIPLE CLAIMANTS, BUT THEY INSTEAD CHOOSE AND AGREE TO
            HAVE ALL DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN DECIDED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL
            ARBITRATION.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            The place of arbitration shall be in New York, unless otherwise
            agreed to in writing by all parties to the arbitration. The parties
            acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction
            involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
            U.S.C. Sections 1–16, shall govern the interpretation, enforcement
            and proceedings pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. The parties
            expressly agree that any and all actions taken under the Arbitration
            Agreement and related provisions, including but not limited to all
            filings, orders, judgments, and awards made in any arbitration
            proceeding, are confidential and may not be disclosed to any third
            party.
          </li>

            Time Limitation on Claims- The Parties agree that they must initiate

          </li>
          <li>
            Forum and Venue- A lawsuit, if any, between you and Pain Relief USA
            that is permissible under this Arbitration Agreement will occur in

            that the jurisdiction and venue of these courts is exclusive.
          </li>

            Applicable Law- This Arbitration Agreement and any Dispute between
